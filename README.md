# Python Tutorials for NLP, ML, AI

(C) 2016 by [Damir Cavar](http://cavar.me/damir/)



The files in this folder are iPython-based tutorials for NLP, ML, AI in Python for classes I teach in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
[Computational Linguistics Program](http://cl.indiana.edu/programs.html) in the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.indiana.edu/~lingdept/) at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/).


## Introduction

To run this material in iPython you need to have Python 3.x and Jupyter installed. You can save yourself some trouble by using the [Anaconda Python 3.x distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Clone the project folder using:

	git clone https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-for-ipython.git

To start the Jupyter notebook viewer/editor on your local machine change into the cloned folder and run in command line in it:

	jupyter notebook

A browser window should open up that allows you full access to the notebooks.
