## Introduction

To run this material in [Jupyter] you need to have Python 3.x and [Jupyter] installed. You can save yourself some trouble by using the [Anaconda Python 3.x distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Clone the project folder using:

	git clone https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-for-ipython.git

To start the [Jupyter] notebook viewer/editor on your local machine change into the *notebooks* folder within the cloned project folder and run the following command:

	jupyter notebook

A browser window should open up that allows you full access to the notebooks.

Enjoy!
